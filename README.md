# Toast Component

## Overview
This project aims to empower developers with a deep understanding of React by building a custom Toast component from the ground up. The goal isn't just to create another Toast component; it's about fostering fundamental skills and reducing over-reliance on pre-built libraries.

## Inspiration
We often encounter tempting, ready-made solutions like Radix Primitives' solid Toast component. However, by resisting the allure of pre-built libraries, we prioritize the cultivation of core React competencies. It's not about dismissing the value of libraries but about ensuring proficiency beyond dependency.

## Getting Started
To begin working on the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository.
- Navigate to the project directory - `cd toast-comp`.
- Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`.
- Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.

 ## How to Contribute
Your contributions are welcomed and valued. Feel free to engage in:

- **Code Refactoring**: Improving the component's efficiency or readability.
- **Enhancements**: Adding features or functionality to the Toast component.
- **Documentation**: Improving README or inline comments for better understanding.
